        Matthew Morin is a young man that was born in Massachusetts and still currently lives there. He has only ever been to another states besides Connecticut and hopes that he can travel to other states at some point. He graduated from high school in 2022 along with my brother. Matt has decided not to go to college after graduating from high school and opted instead to work to help support his family and fund his hobbies. He often goes out to have fun with his friends and is usually pretty open about many things. Matt isn't afraid to try new things and is always down to try those new things with his friends. I may not not know too much about him, but the things I do know make him a good friend to my siblings and I as well as to many of his other friends.
